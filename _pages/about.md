- **2024.12** Our paper **"Exploring Cultural and Intergenerational Dynamics in Voice Assistant Design for Chinese Older Adults“** have been accepted by **IMWUT（Ubicomp）2025**！ 🎉 🎉
  
- **2024.12**: Our paper **"Informal Learning on Douyin Among Chinese Older Adults“** have been accepted by **CSCW 2025**！ 🎉 🎉

- **2024.11** Our paper **"Gaining Technological Autonomy and Social-emotional Support: A Case Study of How and Why Chinese Older Adults Engage with a Semi-acquaintance Online Community"** has received the **ACM CSCW 2024 DEI Recognition**. DEI Recognition, which stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Recognition, is awarded annually to research that addresses information disadvantaged groups, recognizing outstanding contributions to achieving technological fairness and accessibility.  🎉 🎉

- **2024.09** Our project **"VoiceConnect: Voice Interaction System for Application Control"** won **the Silver Award** at the **2024 Shanghai International College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition**. This project employs our self-developed LLM-based user intent understanding technology to accurately recognize and interpret users' operational intentions on smart devices. Through LLM-based understanding of graphical interface elements, it achieves automated application operations, complemented by multimodal interaction methods, enabling precise capture of user intent, smooth execution of operations, and fluid interaction feedback. This technology can be used to implement next-generation intent-driven smart interaction methods and enable automated, scalable testing of user interfaces. It has been successfully applied in automated testing of apps like Meituan. This represents our latest achievement in user understanding, interface analysis, and AI-empowered user design.  🎉 🎉

- **2024.05** Our project **"VoiceJoy: Age-Friendly Smart Voice Assistant for Mobile Applications"** won **the Second Prize at the 2024 Fudan University AI Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition**. The project leverages AI to empower older adults, addressing mobile application barriers through an innovative "emotionally age-friendly" approach. It uniquely incorporates multi-turn dialogue, modular modifications, and multimodal feedback to support intuitive interaction for elderly users, reducing their learning costs and cognitive burden, enhancing their ability to use digital applications, and increasing digital well-being for the aging population. 🎉 🎉

- **2024.03** Our paper **"Gaining Technological Autonomy and Soci-emotional Support: A Case Study of How and Why Chinese Older Adults Engage with a Semi-acquaintance Online Community"** was accepted by **The 27th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW'24)**.🎉 🎉

- **2023.12** Our paper **"Overcoming Barriers, Achieving Goals: A Case Study of an Older User's Technology Autonomy"** was accepted by **The ACM CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'24) as a case-study paper**.🎉 🎉
